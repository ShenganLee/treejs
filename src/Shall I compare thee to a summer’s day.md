## Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day

## 我可否将你比作一个夏日

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

我可否把你比作一个夏日

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

可你比它更温和更可爱

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

狂风吹落五月的花蕾

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.

夏天匆匆已过

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

太阳是天上的眼散发炽热的注视

And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;

它金黄般的容颜有时会暗淡

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

任何美好的事物难免有朝云散

By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed.

与年日随自然变迁远去 

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st.

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

任何美好的事物难免有朝云散

你不会失去属于你的美丽
